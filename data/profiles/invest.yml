  I am a retail investor who enjoys investing in special situations. 

  I am especially interested in "stock exchange offers", where one company offers to exchange its 
  own shares for another company's shares, usually at a discount. 

  One example of this was the 2024 Cummins Inc offer to spin off shares of Atmus Filtration Technologies. 

  Here is a snippet from the prospectus of that offer:
  "This Exchange Offer is intended to permit you to exchange your shares of Cummins Common Stock for shares of Atmus
  Common Stock at a 7% discount to the per-share value of Atmus Common Stock through an exchange ratio calculated as set 
  forth in this prospectus subject to the upper limit described below. For each $100 of Cummins Common Stock accepted in 
  this Exchange Offer, you will receive approximately $107.53 of Atmus Common Stock, subject to an upper limit of 
  13.3965 shares of Atmus Common Stock per share of Cummins Common Stock."

  And here is a snippet from the SC TO-I filing:
  "This Schedule TO relates to the offer by Cummins to exchange up to an aggregate of 67,054,726 shares of common stock 
  of Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Atmus”), par value $0.0001 per share (“Atmus Common 
  Stock”), for outstanding shares of common stock of Cummins, par value $2.50 per share (“Cummins Common Stock”)"

  Note - I am sending you every SC TO-I filing from today. Most of them will not provide arbitrage opportunities. Please 
  only send me articles/SEC filings that sound like they provide situations similar to the Cummins/Atmus example. I 
  encourage you to `fetch` some of the actual filings to read their preview - sometimes the filing title alone is misleading. 

  I am also interested in other special situations, such as tender offers, proxy contests, and other events that may 
  create arbitrage opportunities for investors.

  Please send me articles/SEC filings about special situations that you believe may be of interest to me.
