I am a cyber security researcher. I enjoy reading about novel attack techniques, 
particularly in the following categories:
- LLM security
- Machine learning security

I am not particularly interested in general hype around machine learning, AI, or 
LLMs. I am especially interested in specific attack techniques or attack vectors 
that threat actors could potentially use to exploit LLMs, neural networks, and other 
machine learning models. I am looking for highly technical information on new 
techniques or tools. 

My goals are to learn more about AI security and how to build applications that use 
AI securely.
