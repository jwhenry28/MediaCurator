For each $100 of Cummins Common Stock accepted in \nthis Exchange Offer, you will receive approximately $107.53 of Atmus Common Stock, subject to an upper limit of \n13.3965 shares of Atmus Common Stock per share of Cummins Common Stock.\"\n\nAnd here is a snippet from the SC TO-I filing:\n\"This Schedule TO relates to the offer by Cummins to exchange up to an aggregate of 67,054,726 shares of common stock \nof Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Atmus”), par value $0.0001 per share (“Atmus Common \nStock”), for outstanding shares of common stock of Cummins, par value $2.50 per share (“Cummins Common Stock”)\"\n\nNote - I am sending you every SC TO-I filing from today. Most of them will not provide arbitrage opportunities. Please \nonly send me articles/SEC filings that sound like they provide situations similar to the Cummins/Atmus example. I \nencourage you to `fetch` some of the actual filings to read their preview - sometimes the filing title alone is misleading. \n\nI am also interested in other special situations, such as tender offers, proxy contests, and other events that may \ncreate arbitrage opportunities for investors.\n\nPlease send me articles/SEC filings about special situations that you believe may be of interest to me.\n","recipient":"jwhenry28@gmail.com","seeds":["https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=\u0026CIK=\u0026type=SC+TO-I\u0026owner=include\u0026count=100\u0026action=getcurrent"]}
