For each $100 of Cummins Common Stock accepted in \nthis Exchange Offer, you will receive approximately $107.53 of Atmus Common Stock, subject to an upper limit of \n13.3965 shares of Atmus Common Stock per share of Cummins Common Stock.\"\n\nAnd here is a snippet from the SC TO-I filing:\n\"This Schedule TO relates to the offer by Cummins to exchange up to an aggregate of 67,054,726 shares of common stock \nof Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Atmus”), par value $0.0001 per share (“Atmus Common \nStock”), for outstanding shares of common stock of Cummins, par value $2.50 per share (“Cummins Common Stock”)\"\n\nNote - I am sending you every SC TO-I filing from today. Most of them will not provide arbitrage opportunities. Please \nonly send me articles/SEC filings that sound like they provide situations similar to the Cummins/Atmus example.\n\nI am also interested in other special situations, such as tender offers, proxy contests, and other events that may \ncreate arbitrage opportunities for investors.\n\nPlease send me articles/SEC filings about special situations that you believe may be of interest to me.\n","recipient":"jwhenry28@gmail.com","seeds":["https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=\u0026CIK=\u0026type=SC+TO-I\u0026owner=include\u0026count=100\u0026action=getcurrent"]}
