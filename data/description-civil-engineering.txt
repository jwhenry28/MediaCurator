I am a software programming who is interested in building LLM agents that 
help with a Civil Engineering firm. 

I want to build projects that save engineers time and money, making them 
more efficient at their jobs. 

I am interested in tools and techniques that relate to building LLM agents. 
I am especially interested in cross-sections between LLMs and Civil Engineering.

I am not particularly interested in general hype around machine learning, AI, or 
LLMs. I am especially interested in specific tools and techniques that make it 
easier for engineers to process data, make decisions, and organize information.

Please only send me articles about tools or techniques that directly leverage LLMs. I 
am not interested in articles about tools or techniques that, while useful to 
data processing or decision-making generally, do not leverage LLMs.

Even for content that does leverage LLMs, please be judicious. Pick only a handful of 
articles that are most relevant to my task. I do not want a deluge of articles to read.
