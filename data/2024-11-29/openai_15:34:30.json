I enjoy reading about novel attack techniques, \nparticularly in the following categories:\n- LLM security\n- Machine learning security\n\nI am not particularly interested in general hype around machine learning, AI, or \nLLMs. I am especially interested in specific attack techniques or attack vectors \nthat threat actors could potentially use to exploit LLMs, neural networks, and other \nmachine learning models. I am looking for highly technical information on new \ntechniques or tools. \n\nMy goals are to learn more about AI security and how to build applications that use \nAI securely. \n","recipient":"joseph@hackandpray.com","seeds":["https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning/recommended"]}
